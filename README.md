## Overview:

FinFET Circuit Design and Characterization is a hands-on workshop for advanced-node skills. Built directly on open repositories with the ASAP7 (7 nm) predictive platform, you will work in Xschem and Ngspice using BSIM-CMG device models. The curriculum follows an industry-aligned loop: design, simulate, verify, document — emphasizing credible methods, reproducible datasets, and trusted figures that meet international expectations for research and product teams.

 

You will begin at the device level with NFET and PFET characterization, extracting complete I-V families, transconductance (gm), output resistance (ro), and practical bias points. You will then construct an inverter, generate and interpret its voltage transfer characteristic (VTC), and quantify switching point, noise margins, and static current. Each lab includes sensible sweep ranges, pre-checked netlists, and measurement recipes so you can focus on learning rather than tool friction. Results are archived for traceability.

 

The program then extends to a precision bandgap reference at 7 nm, guided by instructor-supplied schematics and netlists aligned with the repository’s figures. You will reproduce and analyze reference plots — temperature stability, line and load regulation, output resistance, and startup behavior — while learning repeatable techniques for biasing and compensation. Automated supply and temperature sweeps, optional PVT corners, and Monte Carlo mismatch runs help you benchmark outcomes against published literature and communicate confidence in your results.

 

Graduates leave with a coherent portfolio: annotated netlists, verified waveforms, tables, and engineering narratives that demonstrate readiness for advanced-node roles. We include templates, checklists, and scripts to accelerate future projects, plus guidance on documenting methods for submission or engineering reviews. Whether you are targeting graduate research, analog or ASIC design, or high-impact internships, this workshop equips you with practical 7 nm experience and evidence of competence that travels globally.
